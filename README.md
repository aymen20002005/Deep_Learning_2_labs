# Deep_Learning_2_labs

These are the labs of the course Deep Learning 2 at Telecom Paris:
* __Training_GAN_on_MNIST__: Training a Generator and a Discriminator to generate digits. Something that was quite interesting in the lab is the study of the interpolation in the latent space. We have concluded in the lab that during an interpolation between two points in the latent space, there is a high probability of passing through classes other than those of the two points involved in the interpolation.
